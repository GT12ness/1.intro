1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list. ``[33, 4, 6.6, 11, 4]``

2. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list. ``[33, 4, 66, 11, 4]``

3. Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing
 order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples:
Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]
